# VS_SFML_Template
This template contains a Visual Studio project and the precompiled SFML version 2.6.1 for Visual C++ 17 (2022) - 64-bit.

The configuration properties are setup for static linked Debug and Release, so no .dll files are needed. If you wish, you can download SFML directly from the [official SFML website](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.6.1/).
